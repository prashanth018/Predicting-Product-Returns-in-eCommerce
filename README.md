# Predicting-Product-Returns-in-eCommerce

Project aims at assessing the likelihood of a product return in real-time while customers put together their shopping basket. Basing on the probability of return, We would either be rewarding the customer by offering promotions/gift voucher/loyalty points or penalizing the customer by increasing shipping surcharge or removing cash on delivery payment option. We have successfully integrated this feature with the Oracle e-Commerce Product.
